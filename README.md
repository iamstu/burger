# burger

This app is deployed on heroku at https://secure-spire-17872.herokuapp.com/
In this you can add a new burger through a post request to the database and it will appear in the left. If a burger is clicked it will be considered "eaten" and moved to the right through a put request and a page reload. 

All html is done through handlebars.
